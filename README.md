## Inspiration
Farmers, who live in remote areas, have to travel long distance to marketplace in order to sell their products and due to so many intermediate supply chains they have to sell it at a lower price. So, in order to sell their products at an efficient amount, we offer you to effortlessly market your crop with direct transaction between buyers and sellers. Through Agro Acres, the farmers will able to sell all of their produce and none of it remains unsold or turns into waste. That's how it becomes beneficial to the farmers.

It provides latest government news on agricultural policies to farmers which might be helpful in order to sell their crops. Through this platform, remote farmers can sell all of their produce in an efficient manner only between seller and buyer. Retailer/wholesaler could get a variety of price rates for a specific crop, which will also helpful in saving their money. It can also provide forum for complaints to all users where any type of fraud can be detected.
